"""
mediation.py — unified response envelope for the whole server family (v2.3.0).

One file, vendored byte-identical into cinii-mcp, jstage-mcp, ndl-mcp and
korea-scholarship-mcp. Until 19 Aug 2026 there were **two** files both calling
themselves 2.1.0 and neither carrying the other's work:

  * the Japanese copy had emit() — ledger persistence — and classified Hangul as
    'latin', so a correct Korean query raised the romanisation warning;
  * the Korean copy knew Hangul and the CJK extensions but had no emit(), so
    Korean queries never reached the hash-chained deposit that every Japanese
    query entered.

2.2.0 is the union. Everything is additive: a consumer reading `.ja` or calling
dumps() is unaffected, so the Japanese servers can adopt it without migration.

The union was assembled from the Korean copy, which never carried the
`searched_for` headline that v2.1.0 introduced, and the field was lost in the
merge. It is restored here. It is the field the whole second limb of the
disclosure standard rests on — the term the assistant chose, hoisted where a
relaying client cannot drop it — so its absence would have made 2.2.0 a
silent regression on the one thing this envelope exists to make visible.

Design rule, unchanged: every interpretation key is a typed field, not prose.
The output is deterministic — typed facts and typed diagnostics only, never a
server-composed summary or relevance score. A tool may show its choices; it may
not make them on the scholar's behalf.

Standard library only, except for the optional ledger import at the foot of the
file, which degrades to a no-op when ledger.py is not vendored alongside.
