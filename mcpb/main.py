"""Entry point of the Claude Desktop bundle for semantic-scholar-mcp.

The bundle vendors no libraries. Its manifest declares server.type "uv", so
Claude Desktop runs this file with uv from the folder it sits in:

    uv --directory <bundle>/server run --frozen <bundle>/server/main.py

uv reads pyproject.toml and uv.lock beside this file, uses a Python already
on the machine that satisfies requires-python (downloading one only if there
is none), installs the locked dependencies into <bundle>/server/.venv, and starts the same stdio
server the console script starts. The first launch downloads; later ones do
not.

# the placeholder itself, verbatim (measured on 1.46 with this bundle: the
# ledger wrote its file into a folder named "${user_config.receipts_dir}" and
# stamped "${user_config.receipt_session}" on the line), and older hosts sent
# an empty string. Either means "unset", for every variable: a credential
# left blank must not be sent to the provider as a key, and a receipts folder
# left blank must not become a folder. Strip both before the package imports.
