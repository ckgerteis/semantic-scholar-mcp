"""Entry point of the Claude Desktop bundle for semantic-scholar-mcp.

The bundle vendors no libraries. Its manifest declares server.type "uv" and
keeps pyproject.toml, uv.lock and this file together at the bundle root,
which is the layout Claude Desktop's UV runtime expects. When the extension
is installed the app runs `uv sync` there with uv (one on the PATH, else a
copy it downloads), using a
Python already on the machine that satisfies requires-python (downloading one
only if there is none) and installing the locked dependencies into
<bundle>/.venv. Each launch then runs, from the bundle folder:

    uv run --directory <bundle> --frozen main.py

which reuses that environment and starts the same stdio server the console
script starts. Where a host skipped the install-time step, the same command
builds the environment on first launch instead; later launches do not.

# stamped "${user_config.receipt_session}" on the line), and older hosts sent
# an empty string. Either means "unset", for every variable: a credential
# left blank must not be sent to the provider as a key, and a receipts folder
# left blank must not become a folder. Strip both before the package imports.
